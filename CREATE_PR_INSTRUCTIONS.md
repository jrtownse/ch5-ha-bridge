# 📋 Instructions to Create Pull Request

Your changes have been committed locally and are ready to be pushed to GitHub. Follow these steps to create the pull request:

## Step 1: Push Your Branch

Since GitHub credentials aren't configured in this environment, you'll need to push from your local machine:

### Option A: If you have GitHub CLI installed
```bash
# Push the branch
git push -u origin feature/improve-ha-dashboard

# Create PR directly
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: Major enhancements - resolve all GitHub issues & add deployment automation" \
  --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md \
  --base main
```

### Option B: Using Git and Web Browser
```bash
# 1. First, set up your GitHub credentials if needed
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# 2. Push the branch
git push -u origin feature/improve-ha-dashboard

# 3. GitHub will show a message with a link to create a PR
# Or go to: https://github.com/jrtownse/ch5-ha-bridge/pull/new/feature/improve-ha-dashboard
```

## Step 2: Create Pull Request on GitHub

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/jrtownse/ch5-ha-bridge
2. You should see a yellow banner saying "feature/improve-ha-dashboard had recent pushes"

4. Set:
